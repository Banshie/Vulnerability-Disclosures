# Banshie Disclosure Policy
This policy outlines how the Banshie handles responsible vulnerability disclosure to product vendors, security vendors and the general public. Banshie will responsibly and promptly notify the appropriate product vendor of a security flaw with their product(s) or service(s). The first attempt at contact will be through any appropriate contacts or formal mechanisms listed on the vendor Web site, or by sending an e-mail to security@, support@, info@, and secure@company.com with the pertinent information about the vulnerability.

If a vendor fails to acknowledge Banshie notification within five business days, then Banshie may issue a public advisory disclosing its findings fifteen business days after the initial contact.

If a vendor response is received within the timeframe outlined above, Banshie will allow the vendor 90 days to address the vulnerability with a security patch or other corrective measure as appropriate. At the end of the deadline, if a vendor is not responsive or unable to provide a reasonable statement as to why the vulnerability is not fixed, Banshie will publish a limited advisory including mitigation. If the vulnerability is fixed within 90 days, technical details are published shortly after the fix. Extensions to the 90-day disclosure timeline will not be granted.

If a product vendor is unable to, or chooses not to, patch a particular security flaw, Banshie will offer to work with that vendor to publicly disclose the flaw with some effective workarounds. In no cases will an acquired vulnerability be "kept quiet" because a product vendor does not wish to address it. To maintain transparency into our process, we plan on publishing a summary of the communication we've had with the vendor regarding the issue. Banshie will make every effort to work with vendors to ensure they understand the technical details and severity of a reported security flaw.
